> **EnjoyIt** is a **clean**, **elegant** but **advanced** blog theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

It is based on [CodeIT](https://github.com/sunt-programator/CodeIT/), which is based on the original [LoveIt Theme](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt), [LeaveIt Theme](https://github.com/liuzc/LeaveIt), and [KeepIt Theme](https://github.com/Fastbyte01/KeepIt).

Since the three themes have a similar look, if you have questions about their differences,
read [Why to choose EnjoyIt](#why-choose-EnjoyIt) so that you can choose the one that works best for you.

## Brief history

### Brief history of CodeIT
This theme is based on the original [LoveIt](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt) theme. The original theme was loved by many users, but since May 2020 it has not been maintained.

We tried to contact the theme [owner](https://github.com/dillonzq), but without success. The contributors have opened an [issue](https://github.com/dillonzq/LoveIt/issues/514) and asked if the theme is still supported, but we also did not receive any response.

So we decided to create and maintain the theme with a new name, keeping the original style, but continuously improving it. Feel free to contribute to this theme üòä.

### Brief history of EnjoyIt
I want to customize my own blog theme, without redundant features, also with features I like but others may think redundant.
Enjoy blogging, enjoy it.

## [Demo Site](https://xinyu-yang.github.io/)

To see this theme in action, here is a live [demo site](https://xinyu-yang.github.io/) that is rendered with the **EnjoyIt** theme.
